Terms and conditions for use, reproduction and distribution
of the materials in this repository.

1. Not "Open-Source"

This project is not "Open-Source" in OSI definition.
It is rather "Source-Available", at least for now, while it is yet been tested.

But this license is going to be changed to proper "open-source" (probably MIT or Apache)
in future.

2. Allowed to study

This project is made public mainly for educational purposes.
So everyone is allowed to:
- study these sources
- propose changes and improvements via PR's
- run it on private machine or in the closed networks (e.g. for college contest).

3. Prohibitions

What is not allowed:
- reusing this project targeting unlimited audience
    without consent of its original contributors (such exceptions
    should be documented here) - e.g. to build other educational servers;
- using this project for any harmful purpose.
- everything which is not explicitly allowed by this license note (feel free
    to request modifications of license in such cases).

(The restriction on reusing don't meet the definition of OpenSource Initiative)

4. Rationale

Why it is so? This project is not professional product, and its contributors are not
expected to be experts. So it (or its derivatives) may lack certain security features
or have some flaws leading to inconvenience for end-users. Hopefully we can improve
this situation in future and make the license "proper open-source".

We do not provide any warranty, but even more - we don't want feel any kind of "moral"
responsibility for any problems or complications arising from the misuse of this software.

(again, if personal exception is needed, please submit your request)
